  Parent nonprofit organization for the Semantic Infrastructure Lab (SIL).
  Building the semantic substrate for trustworthy AI through:
  - Semantic memory systems (provenance, verification)
  - Universal semantic representations (USIR)
  - Deterministic computation engines
  - Progressive disclosure tools
  - Open standards for AI transparency

    note: |
      Identity crisis resolved: Sync script fixed to use foundation/website-content source.
      Deployed to production with correct Foundation identity (governance, funding).
      Maintenance mode capability documented in DEPLOYMENT.md.
      Production: https://semanticinfrastructurefoundation.org (tia-apps:8011)
      Staging: https://sif-staging.mytia.net (tia-staging:8082)

    note: |
      Website deployed to production (staging + production containers).
      Staging: https://sif-staging.mytia.net (tia-staging:8082)
      Production: Port 8011 on tia-apps (needs DNS + SSL for semanticinfrastructurefoundation.org)
      Content: 4 Foundation pages (Timeline A vs B narrative)
      Branding: Clean fork from SIL, all Lab→Foundation updates complete

strategy: |
  SIF (Foundation) is the parent nonprofit that funds and supports SIL (Lab).
  SIF focuses on building foundational semantic infrastructure for trustworthy AI.
  Timeline A (Grey Fog) vs Timeline B (Glass Box) positioning.
  
  Current stage: Early formation, no 501(c)(3) yet, building proof systems.
  Production systems: Reveal, Morphogen, TiaCAD, GenesisGraph.
